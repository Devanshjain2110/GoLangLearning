# GoLangLearning

A repository to track my journey of learning Go (Golang).

## Learning Path
I am following:
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) — practical, annotated examples of Go concepts


## Repository Structure
- **basics/**  

   **HelloWorld/** 
  - `hello-world.go` — first program in Go  
  **Values/** 
  - `values.go` — exploring constants, variables, and basic data types  

As I progress, I’ll continue adding examples and exercises from *Go by Example* and the official docs into structured folders.
